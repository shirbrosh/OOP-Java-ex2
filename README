this exercise contains the following java classes:
SpaceShipFactory- This class acts as the driver to create all spaceship objects.
SpaceShip - The spaceship object that is used in the SpaceWars game.
HumaneShip- The human spaceship object that is used in the SpaceWars game.
RunnerShip- The Runner spaceship object that is used in the SpaceWars game.
BasherShip- The busher spaceship object that is used in the SpaceWars game.
AggrShip - The Aggressive spaceship object that is used in the SpaceWars game.
DrunkShip- The drunkard spaceship object that is used in the SpaceWars game.
SpecialShip- The special spaceship object that is used in the SpaceWars game.

=============================
I chose to use inheritance- SpaceShip is the base class and all other spaceship types (human, runner, basher,
aggressive, drunkard and special) inherit from her. I used the given API in the SpaceShip class and added one
function (further description in the Implementation details section).

=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
I added to the SpaceShip class the function upDateEnergy which checks if the energy doesn't go bellow zero,
and updates it after a hit (either getting shot or colliding), it helps to prevent code duplicate.
The ships class contains the doAction function, that inherit its action from SpaceShip and adds different
behavior for each spaceship according to the game rolls.
The HumanShip also contains an override for the getImage function to receive a different spaceship icon.

=    Answers to questions   =
=============================
DrunkardShip- in my drunkard ship i changed the ship's icon to a corona beer using a createImageIcon function,
    this is a drunkard ship, so it has a hard time driving, it only does circles because its always
    accelerating and turning to the right.
SpecialShip- my special ship is an alien (also changed the icon using a createImageIcon function),
    the alien is scared of people, so when he feels no danger hes always accelerating straight, but when a
    spaceship comes closer then a 0.30 units he gets scared and crazy and starts accelerating to the left and
    shooting everywhere.
